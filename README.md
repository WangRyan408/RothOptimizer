# RothOptimizer
RothOptimizer is a Java program that calculates the optimal yearly amounts to convert from a Traditional IRA to a Roth IRA. It considers tax brackets, required minimum distributions (RMDs), income levels, and long-term growth assumptions to minimize lifetime tax liability while maximizing after-tax retirement income.
